---
1. Log on to Craigslist and select "cars+trucks" in the for sale section
2. Select "by owner"
3. On the left hand side check "bundle duplicates"
4. Enter the model you are looking for
5. Enter a price minimum of $1200 or $1500 on the price minimum to weed out people who put $1 as the price.
6. For mileage put 10,000 as the minimum and your target top mileage for the maximum to weed out people who put 1 or 270 for mileage (really meaning 270k!)
7. If your search yields sufficient results then copy the craigslist link
8. Head over to IFTTT and copy the link to this Applet:
   <a href="https://ifttt.com/applets/CYpiZcew-get-an-email-whenever-a-new-craigslist-post-matches-your-search">Craigslist email</a>
9. This should generate a few emails each day with new posts fitting the criterea specified
10. Contact the sellers generated from this search
11. Arrange for a test drive
12. Before meeting the seller log on to: <a href="https://www.kbb.com">Kelley Blue Book</a>
12. Enter in the details of the car
13. When you meet the seller have two prices written down, the "trade-in" value and the good condition private party value
14. If you like the car after the test drive offer somewhere between "trade-in" and good condition private party value
15. Continue this process until you find a willing seller.
16. Make sure to have cash and offer immediately after the test drive
17. Keep going until you strike a deal with a willing seller
