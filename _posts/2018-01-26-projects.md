I'm contemplating picking up a project car for motivation.  Some ideas I'm kicking around are:
1. 1999-2001 Jeep Cherokee  4 door with some decent tires and a lift kit
2. 2005 or newer Chevy cargo van  with a full bed in the back and insulated.
3. Chevy police interceptor cop car
4. A big beautiful Ford Country Squire station wagon 1975-1980
