title: Time for more failure?
---
I was listening to The Armchair Expert with Dax Shephard interviewing Seth Meyers and something he said really grabbed me.  The best of the best
at SNL every week would average 3 out of 10 funny skits in pitching for Saturday Night Live.  The funniest people would fail 7 out of ten times every week in trying to write a funny script.  What this means
is massive failure is the only path to massive success.
