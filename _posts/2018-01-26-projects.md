I'm contemplating picking up a project car for motivation.  Some ideas I'm kicking around are:

1994-2001 Jeep Cherokee  4 door with some decent tires and a lift kit

2005 or newer Chevy cargo van  with a full bed in the back and insulated.

Chevy police interceptor cop car

A big beautiful Ford Country Squire station wagon 1975-1980
