Say it's late and you happen to forget your wallet and have some change rattling around in your pocket.  You are starving and near a Chipotle.  
While you would love a burrito you don't have the funds.  Here's what you do.  Order a burrito with just black(or pinto beans). Chipotle treats
it as a side and charges you $1.  Further ask for a second tortilla. Now you have a fairly large burrito full of healthy black beans and two tortillas for $1!
Also, depending on your preferences this is vegatarian/vegan approved.  What a great way to eat frugally!
