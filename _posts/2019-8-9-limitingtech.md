title: Two things I do to limit technology use
---
It's amazing how technology has seeped into our lives.  No longer can we ride up an elevator without having 
to look down at our phones.  I think this attention hijacking is doing all kinds of long term damage to our brains, some damage we probably 
aren't even aware of yet. Here's what I do:
<br>
 1. Limit my data use to 1GB per month through <a href="https://republicwireless.com">Republic Wireless</a>.  Not only do they have a wonderful desktop texting program, but the service is solid. I find myself wanting to look at my phone but the 1GB limit keeps me in check.  I've ran out of data once in the last year and running out is a good exercise as most things work on wifi and data isn't necessary most of the time.  I'm contemplating just keeping the text/phone service and adding data if I absolutely need it a certain month, like on vacation or when I'm going to be on the road.
<br>
 2. On my phone, I do have <a href="https://www.facebook.com/robotrobertson">Facebook</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/robotrobertson">Twitter</a>/<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidcrobertson/">LinkedIn</a>(I know.. shocker!!).  They are nowhere to be found on the homescreen.  I have them 
in a folder to remove the temptation.  This really works.  There aren't any notifications allowed and I find once in a while I use them, and my use is under an hour a week.
