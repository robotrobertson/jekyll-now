It would be a fun exercise to make a list of companies that offer a week or more of training off site(paid of course). 
It would take a tremendous amount of work, but it would be a really interesting experience to have perepetual training.
You'd fly go throught the training, fly back, then give your notice.  In the background you'd be negotiating with the new company,
timing it so you would start training after you get back from the former company.  If this was a book I would love to read it.  You'd get all types of experiences, people, and stories.  

I remember my own work training vividly as I had a great time in Minneapolis, saw two Twins baseball games and enjoyed the city.  I'd probably never do this on my own and when you take away the cost
of flight and hotel, it allows you to experience things fully.  You don't feel as though you have to "get your money's worth" from the city.
