title: Destination Workouts
---
I've been experimenting with destination workouts.  For example, I need to be at the bus to make it work at 7:25AM.  This means I need to leave my house at 6:40AM and run fairly hard to make it on time.  If I don't run hard I miss the bus, which is very motivating. There are  mornings where I don't feel that great and the destination workout is the perfect recipe to fix my sluggishness. I fight myself for a bit, but then get into a rythm and then feel ALIVE.
