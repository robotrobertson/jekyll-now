title: Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee
---
My wonderful wife and I thought it would be a fun project to visit all of the places Jerry Seinfeld went with his guest on the show
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.  First one checked off the list is House of Pies in Los Angeles with Kristen Wiig.  The pie was the
best I've ever tasted and the place was located in a very hip neighborhood near Los Feliz.  Thank you Jerry!
