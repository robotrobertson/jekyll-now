title: Fed Meeting...rates up or down?
---

The Federal Reserve is finishing up its two day meeting today and is widely expected to raise the discount rate by .25%. 
The bigger implications are where rates are going after the announcement.  The 10 year treasury in the United States is up .57% since the election which is an huge move.
I have a feeling the trades have already been made ahead of time and barring some crazy Fed language we'll see yields calm down a bit.  
I have a hard time believing Donald Trump is so "inflationary" and it seems more like a trade is being made.  
The short interest in the 10 year has hit it's high for the year and I imagine some traders might get caught today.  It'll be interesting to see.


Prediction: 10 year treasury: 2.4% after the Federal Reserve announcement.
