title: Electric Mountain Bike

---
I've added a 750 watt Bafang motor to a Diamond Back old school mountain bike I got for free, and shocks and a front disk brake.  I've ridden it twice and both times have reached over 30 MPH!  Both times I was laughing like a crazy person, it's really fun.  Climbing in the dirt is a new and insane experience.  20 MPH uphill is addictive.  I'm hoping to put in 2-3 rides per week and learn the ins and outs of the electric motor and battery.  It's been a really fun project so far and I plan on adding video on long off road rides. I can go much, much farther because of the superpower electric motor.  Now a 30 mile bike ride is a breeze.  I've had technical difficulties on each ride so hopefully I'll get in the groove soon.  Stay tuned!<br><br>
