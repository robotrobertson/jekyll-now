I've been reducing my book count lately.  It's a  hard excercise because I have so many amazing books.
The ultimate goal is to get to my top 10 books.  10 books I absolutely will not part with.  Some of the front runners are:

1. How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie
2. Cool Tools by Kevin Kelly
3. Win Bigly by Scott Adams
4. How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big by Scott Adams
5. The Magic of Thinking Big by David Schwartz
6. A Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson
