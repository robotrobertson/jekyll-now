I've been giving blood for few years now.  I do it because it lowers my blood pressure and the fantastic feeling I receive by helping
others.  I can literally feel the additional energy the next day and into the next week.  I highly recommend giving blood as blood leaving your body
makes you feel appreciation for life.  Life is a gift and this is a unique way to enjoy it.  So get out there and give some blood!
