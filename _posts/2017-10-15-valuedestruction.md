title: Value Destroyed
---
I've been pondering the total value of cars' depreciation since the inception of the automobile.  For example, how much value have cars destroyed in aggregate since the beginning of automobile manufacturing.
It would be interesting to get a number on electronics companies and how much value they have destroyed as well.  Total cell phones purchased minus depreciation would be a very interesting number.  I have a lot of thinking to do on this.
