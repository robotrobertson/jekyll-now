It's not a matter of if but when.  Banks regularly get hacked and spend untold billions and hours trying to prevent people hacking debit cards, credit cards,
accounts, etc. Tech companies really haven't had to do this.  Sure a virus or some security issue pops up, but tech companies have never really 
been in charge of consumers cards and money, until now.  It's one thing to lose your email password, entirely another thing to not have money to buy
food!
