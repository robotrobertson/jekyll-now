title: Cheap vs. Expensive Time
---
Morning time is so expensive.  It goes by so quickly and no matter how much you estimate, the thing you are working on seems to take longer.
I love cheap wonderful evening time.  I love filling up the car with gas, going on a run, reading and any other activity that could take a long time.
The pressure isn't there and you can really enjoy the activities rather than having to rush through them.  I intentionally try to have 
minimal items in the morning as a buffer against things that could come up.  Even then it seems like I'm rushing and the time goes by so fast!
