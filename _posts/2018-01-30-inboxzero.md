title: Inbox Zero 2018
---
I've been thinking alot about my gmail account.  I've given Google permission to search all of my data in order to market to me.  
This is a huge invasion of privacy I've blindly agreed to.  To remedy this I've deleted all emails from my gmail account.  It took approximately a week, but there were many emails with my personal information! Driver's license, W2's all kinds of things very easy
to steal.  Now I have a clean slate and a whole new philosophy on email.  Email is for short communications, not storage.  Storage will
be searched and marketed to.  Also, if(when) there is a data hack, I'll be clean vs. the millions of people who store their personal
information on email.  What a great exercise to do every year to find things you might need to follow up on.
