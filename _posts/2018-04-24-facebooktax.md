title: Facebook tax
---
As the tech companies of Silicone Valley are doing everything in their power to engineer addicting products, I propose a tax.  If cigarettes 
are addicting and taxed, we should impose a tax on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, etc because they are addicting.  As I see some of the insidious things the tech companies
are doing to my children (snapchat streaks) and how Facebook is using everything about our data to mine for evil purposes, I think we should
have some benefits as a society.  It's time for the Tech companies to do some good in the world.  How nice does a "Social Media Tax" sound?  I 
would love it.  Get to work representatives!
Looks like Marc Benioff agrees <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-execs-called-facebooks-trust-problem-152935213.html">(link)</a>
