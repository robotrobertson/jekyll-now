title: Sunday Electric Mountain Bike Ride
---
Wow, what a blast, ride three is in the books!  Dropping just two gears allows you to climb anything.
The feeling of jamming up a fire road at 20 MPH is incredible.  Passing serious road bikers on the streets has it's own laugh factor too. 
Next up is to bring the bike to work, go deep into a trail by the golf course and see how far I can get in my hour and a half scheduled lunch!
