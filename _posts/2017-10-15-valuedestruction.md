title: Value Destroyed
---
Random question, I've been pondering the total value of cars' depreciation since the inception of the automobile.  For example how much value have cars destroyed in aggregate since the beginning.
Further, how much value have electronics companies destroyed as well.  Total cell phones purchased minus depreciation would be a very interesting number.  I have a lot of thinking to do on this.
