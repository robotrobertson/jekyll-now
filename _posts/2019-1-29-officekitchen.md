title: Office Kitchen
---
The universal layout for corporate kitchens is a microwave, two vending machines, sink and a fridge.  When did the almighty 
corporate kitchen designers take away the oven, stove top and cooking appliances?  It would be a blast to have a co-worker chopping away
and an amazing smell coming from the kitchen.  Most office workers leave for lunch or they bring some awful frozen preservative-laden food from the supermarket.  Keeping cooking in the workplace would bring workers together and allow workers to save a great amount of money and improve their health as well.  My Grandma was the cook for a bank which I think is super awesome.  
It would be fun to incorporate cooking into the daily work day through classes put on by co-workers.  If office workers pooled their resources the results could be very positive through meal sharing, choosing healthier options, and helping others learn to cook.  All companies claim they have a great work/life balance but having cooking and food being a bigger part of work would benefit everyone.
