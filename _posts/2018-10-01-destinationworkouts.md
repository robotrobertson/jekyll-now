title: Destination Workouts:
---
I've been experimenting with destination workouts.  For example, need to be at the bus to make it work at 7:25.  Leave at 6:40 to make a decent pace
run to make it on time.  If I don't run hard or walk, I miss the bus! Motivation!  Riding a bike needing to be at a specific destination at a certain time
really helps me push to make it on time.  There are some mornings where I don't feel that hot, or feel kinda lazy.  The destination workout is the perfect
recipe to fix my sluggishness! I fight myself for a bit, but then get into a rythm and then feel ALIVE! Thank you destination workout.
