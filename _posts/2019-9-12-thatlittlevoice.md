title: That Little Voice
---
I went for a run at 9:50PM last night. After the first few steps the little voice appeared in my head.  "Why don't you just turn around and get some much
needed sleep?" "It's no big deal, you can blow it off." The little voice was <i>extremely</i> pursuasive and I didn't think I was going to
make it.  I kept going and it quieted down.  I was still really tired and was thinking of scrapping the whole thing.  Then, the voice disappeared
altogether.  Despite lack of sleep and a long week after a few miles I was <i>alive!</i> I couldnt' believe it.  Just getting going for a few miles shed all the baggage of the entire week! For me getting over the initial resistance is the key to staying with my workouts.  The tricky part is you don't know how long the little voice is going to last.  The only way to find this out is to simply get started and to fight that little voice with everything you have.
