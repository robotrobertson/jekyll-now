I think it'd be a fun exercise to make a list of companies that offer a week or more of training off site. 
It would take a tremendous amount of work, but it would be a really interesting experience to have perepetual training.
You'd fly go throught the training, fly back, then give your notice.    In the background you'd be negotiating with the new company,
timing it so you would start training ideally after you get back from the former company.
