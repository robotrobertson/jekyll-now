title: Whole Food Plant Based One year later
---
I had my vitals taken May 2018 before going whole-food plant-based.  The results are <b>ASTOUNDING!<B>

1. I weighed 217 pounds in May of 2018, I now weigh 180 a loss of 37 POUNDS!!! 
2. Cholesterol was was 199 now it is 111.  HEART ATTACK PROOF!!
3. Triglycerides were 215 now they are 58, absolutely incredible
4. Waist was 40 inches in 2018, now 33
5. BMI 20.3 now 25.1
Blood pressure 138/83 now 144/86.  Unfortunatly blood pressure was higher and I will address this by two teaspoons of flax in the morning and a cup of 
Hibuscus tea after every meal.
