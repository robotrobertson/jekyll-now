title: The Most Important Thing
---
When I wake up my brain has a plan for me.  Today, the most important item for me is to plan my mountain bike ride this Sunday. 
I'm going to Malibu Creek state park and the logistical issue that needs planning is...is it too far to ride with my EMB range of approximately 27 miles.
So I hop over to Google maps and it is 12 miles each way! Success! By taking the time and planning this ride, I now know to go really easy 
on the battery for the first five miles or so.  Luckily it is almost all downhill, so I'll stay off the electricity until I get to the dirt.
After planning this, my brain is very happy and I have an amazing bike ride to look forward to on Sunday.  The point of this is if I allowed distractions to shape
my day, I would be focused on something my brain doesn't want or care to focus on.  Further, if I started my day with the news or social media,
I'd probably be angry about something that my brain doesn't care about.  What a waste! This is why, especially in the morning I limit my distractions 
to music only. I think music has a positive day shaping quality too so I'm almost always rockin' out! Here's to the most important thing!
