title: Top Ten
---
I've been reducing my book count lately.  It's a hard excercise because I have so many amazing books.
The goal is to get to ten top books.  Ten books that will dazzle and delight my guests and friends.  Some of the front runners are:
1. How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie
2. Cool Tools by Kevin Kelly
3. Win Bigly by Scott Adams
4. How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big by Scott Adams
5. The Magic of Thinking Big by David Schwartz
6. A Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson (I have a lot of Bryson books so they count as one)
7. Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman by Richard Feynman
