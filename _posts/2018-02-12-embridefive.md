title: EMB Ride Five
---
Sunday February 11th I went to Malibu Creek for EMB ride five.  Weather was georgeous and with electricity I was able to go to the M.A.S.H. site and well beyond.  I finished the ride through
Paramount Ranch at extreme high speeds.  To say this was fun is a huge understatement.  I climbed a 9% grade hill with ease laughing the entire time.  After the ride I had my Dad try my EMB.  He loved it.  I'm on a mission to get everyone into electric bikes.
