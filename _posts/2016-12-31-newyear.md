title: Scheduling trips:

---
One big item I learned in 2016 was to schedule my trips in advance. I definitely didn't do this last year and went nowhere!  I subscribe to Tim Ferriss's advice of 90% of the benefit of planning trips ahead is the anticipation.  I'm looking forward to Launch festival April 6th and 7th in San Francisco, a Cal Poly reunion trip May 5-7th, and need to plan a biking and road trip for the summer.  Excited.
