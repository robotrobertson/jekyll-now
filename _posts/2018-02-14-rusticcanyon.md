title: Rustic Canyon EMB Ride
---
On my lunch break I took the EMB to Rustic Canyon golf course which is about a mile away from my work.  There is a fantastic dirt
path that goes deep into the canyon.  My front tire was low on air when I started, so I was a bit nervous as I went close to five
miles out in the canyon.  The ride is very sandy at some points and the electric motor just dominates the sand.  I probably should
upgrade my tires to some with more bite and more puncture resistance too.  The tires held up and the weather was just perfect, nice
and cool with some killer clouds.  I'll probably ride this on Thursday with an additional tube and air just in case.  It would be fun 
to see how far the road goes back.
