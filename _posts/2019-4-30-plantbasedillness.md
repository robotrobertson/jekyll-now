title: Whole Food Plant Based to treat common illness?
---
This last weekend I went for a run Saturday and felt a little off.  As soon as I got home, my glands were swelling and I felt HORRIBLE. 
Head cold that hit me like a Mack Truck.  As I am whole-food plant-based I wondered if there were certain foods that would help my ailment.  My typical routine
with a head cold is to take Tylenol or Nyquil/Dayquil and rest as much as possible.  I thought to myself it probably isn't that good to be drinking alcohol with the 
Nyquil, and Tylenol probably isn't that good for healing a cold.  I went on <a href="nutritionfacts.org"/a> and looked up any food remedies.  Lo and behold, Kiwi fruit has 
been shown in tests to reduce the severity and duration of the common cold.  I read on Medical Medium as well that garlic is a great healer as well.
So I mashed up some garlic in a sweet potato and had some of that and went to the store and bought some organic Kiwi's.  On Sunday night I had my first Kiwi in the evening.
After I ate it, I immediately felt better.  Monday rolled around and I was still pretty sick.  By the end of the day after eating two more Kiwi's, I felt pretty good.
I slept great without any cold medicine and felt decent Tuesday.  I think the Kiwis really had an impact.  The other variable I changed is usually I rest when I'm sick.
This time I lifted weights on Monday, and went running Tuesday.  Not sure if that sped the recovery, but that could have had an impact as well.

The implications of this experiment are really exciting.  I cut probably two to three days off my typical cold suffering, and didn't miss any workouts! All because of the power of food.
