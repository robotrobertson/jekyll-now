title: Electronic Music Group Training
---
I'm a big fan of electronic music.  Imagine a church bus with really loud electronic music and people screaming
to a destination workout.  With the right crowd the energy would be unstoppable.  It could be a weekly Saturday or Sunday event.
A crazy host who whips everyone up into a frenzy on the way to the mountains would be required.  The contrast of high energy vs. 
the serenity of the mountains would fuel amazing workouts.  It could feature runs in the mountains, or outdoor weightlifting like 
Arnold Schwarzenegger in his early days.  If this exists, please let me know, otherwise, I'm going to create it.
P.S. I'd be the host
