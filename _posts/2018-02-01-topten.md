I've been reducing my book count lower.  It's a really hard excercise because I have so many amazing books.
The ultimate goal is to get to my top 10 books.  10 books I absolutely will not part with.  Some of the front runners are

How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie

Cool Tools by Kevin Kelly

Win Bigly by Scott Adams

How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big by Scott Adams

The Magic of Thinking Big by David Schwartz

Stay tuned for updates!
