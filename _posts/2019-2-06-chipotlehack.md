It's late and you forgot your wallet and have some change rattling around in your pocket.  You are STARVING and near a Chipotle.  
While you would love a burrito you don't have the funds.  Here's what you do.  Order a burrito with just black(or pinto beans). Chipotle treats this order as a side and charges you $1.  Ask for a second tortilla for the burrito. Now you have a fairly large burrito full of healthy black beans and two tortillas for $1! This is vegatarian/vegan approved as well.  What a great way to eat frugally!
