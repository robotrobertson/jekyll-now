title: Whole food plant-based diet
---
It's been a month since I switched to a whole food plant-based diet.  It's been very interesting.
A few observations
1.  I went a day without coffee on a Sunday.  I haven't gone a day without coffee EVER.  This is crazy.
2.  Sometimes I crave wine or beer.  These cravings really subsided.  It's weird.  Now I have a hard time finishing a glass of wine.
    My coffee sits on my desk and I rarely finish it.  I'll be at the store and a 6 pack of beer repulses me.
3.  When I think of meat I picture rotting chicken and want to puke.  I used to eat meat daily.
4.  Cheese was pretty hard to give up, but now I am repulsed by it.  So bizarre.  The smell of it is nasty.
5. I now drink coffee straight(when I drink it)
6. I have this sense of wellness and thankfulness that comes in my thoughts from time to time
7. Energy levels have improved especially in the evening.  I feel I'm focused when I'm off work and fully awake until bedtime.
8. Blood pressure 141/90 June 18th 
9. Blood pressure 127/82 July 18th
10. A 14 Systolic drop in blood pressure an 8 point drop in diastolic in one month! Truly impressive.  Also I'm curious to see if these numbers keep coming down as my body heals from the damage I was doing to it with all the bad stuff I was eating.
11. I didn't track my weight, but clothes are fitting looser.  
12. It's harder to quantify my workouts which are bike rides and running, but I think I'm getting faster.  It does feel like my recovery time and soreness
have dropped fairly substantially( I am 40 years old after all!)
13. Shown below is May blood work (Essentially your average fat American)
14. Cholesterol: 199
15.  LDL 120
16.  HDL 45
17. Blood Glucose: 98
18. BMI: 30.4
19. Triglycerides: 215
20. Blood pressure: 138/83
21. I'll update my blood work in August. Stay tuned.
