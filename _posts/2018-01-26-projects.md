I'm contemplating picking up a project car for motivation.  Some ideas I'm kicking around are:

Jeep Cherokee 1994-2001 4 door with some decent tires and a lift kit.
or
Chevy cargo van 2005 or newer with a full bed in the back and insulated.
or
Chevy police interceptor cop car
or
A big beautiful Ford Country Squire station wagon 1975-1980
