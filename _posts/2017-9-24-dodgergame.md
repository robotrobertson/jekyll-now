title: Last Dodger game of the year
---

Excited to see Clayton Kershaw one last time this year as a family.  We have this tradition where I give each daughter $20 at Trader Joe's and they get to buy whatever they want.  Ruby bought a whole loaf of bread last time!! 

Gooooooooooooooooo   Dodgers!!
