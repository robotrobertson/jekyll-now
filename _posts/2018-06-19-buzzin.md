I love the state where my mind is buzzing with ideas and I am in a great mood.  I am able to get into this state with caffeine and a light breakfast and a bike ride.  Other ways to get there are caffeine and walking with headphones on, or sometimes a light run
will do the trick.  Driving a car almost always seems to nullify buzzing as I am constantly distracted and sometimes downright frightened by the other drivers.
