title: Time for more failure?
---
I was listening to The Armchair Expert with Dax Shephard interviewing Seth Meyers and something he said really grabbed me.  The best of the best
at SNL each week would average three out of ten funny skits in pitching for Saturday Night Live.  The funniest people in the country would fail seven out of ten times every week in trying to write a funny script.  Massive failure is the only path to massive success.  Time to fail more.
