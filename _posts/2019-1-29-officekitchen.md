title: Office Kitchen
---
It seems the universal layout for corporate kitchens is a microwave two vending machines a sink and a fridge or two.  When did the almighty 
corporate kitchen designers take away the oven, stove top and cooking appliances?  I think it would be a blast to have a co-worker chopping away
and an amazing smell coming from the kitchen.  Most office workers leave for lunch and go out.  I think keeping cooking in would bring workers together
and allow workers to save a great amount of money and improve their health as well.  My Grandma was the cook for a bank, which I think is super awesome.  
I think it would be even more fun to incorporate cooking into the daily work day through classes put on by co-workers.  If office workers pooled their resources
the results could be very positive.  All companies claim they have a great work/life balance, but actually having cooking and food being a bigger part of 
work would benefit everyone.
