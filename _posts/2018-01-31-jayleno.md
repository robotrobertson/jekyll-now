title: Jay Leno has a flip phone
---
I was watching Comedians in Cars getting Coffee and the other night and Jay Leno was the guest Jerry Seinfeld was interviewing.
Jay Leno has a net worth of 200 million and 200 cars worth approximately 50 million and one thing really jumped out at me.
Jay Leno has a flip phone! And this got me thinking, Jay Leno comedian extrodianaire, classic car collector and incredibly hard worker managing 
to get by with just a flip phone.  Maybe, just maybe it's the lack of smartphone keeping him sharp and working hard.  Limit the distraction, improve your life?  
Maybe, it's time to be different?
