title: Time for more failure?
---
I was listening to The Armchair Expert with Dax Shephard interviewing Seth Meyers from SNL and something he said really grabbed me.  The best of the best
at SNL every week would average about 3 out of 10 funny skits.  The funniest people would fail 7 out of ten times every week in trying to write a funny script.  What this means
is that possibly massive failure is the only path to massive success.
