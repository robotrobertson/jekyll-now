title: Executive Lunch Personal Training Business Idea:
---
This may exist, but it certainly isn't oversaturated.  We all know we need to exercise for health benefits, increased energy, and greater quality of life.
But for the busy executive, this is nearly impossible.  Mornings are possible if you get up REALLY early, but this is hard to stick to.  You could 
drive to a gym after work, but this is such a time suck it is hard to keep to this schedule as well.  Which leaves only one time that is sacred. 
Lunch is something we do every day and can plan our workouts around.  To change at your office, drive to a gym, workout, shower, then drive back takes too long.
So what do you do?
Executive Lunch Personal Training.  We come to your corporate site and train you right there, saving you up to 30 minutes of drive time.  Also, we have executive luxurious showers when you are done in the van.
We're priced at a painful $200/ session in advance, so you definitely will show up as there are no cancellations allowed.
